* Program Description:
* This program will display the BMI of a user after prompting them to
* input their weight (in pounds) and height (in feet and inches) and finally 
* display the US Department of Health & Human Services BMI index weight 
* catagory the user falls in.

/**********************************************************************
* Pseudocode:
*
* -Prompt the user to input their weight
*          -input weight held in float "weight_in_pounds"
* -Prompt the user to input their height
*          -Input height in feet  
*          -Input height in inches
*                  -Find Total_height_in_inches
* -Calculate BMI using the supplied equation
*          -(BMI = weight_in_pounds / pow(total_height_in_inches,2)*703)
* -Display BMI (with 2 decimal places) 
* -Display user's US Department of Health & Human Services BMI rating
* -Pause to read output
* -End main
